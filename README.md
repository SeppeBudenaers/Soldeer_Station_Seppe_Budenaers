The purpose of this project is to build a soldering station able to fit the JBC C245 soldering iron. The design relies on the soldering station described in the Elektor magazine (issue 507) (Elektor Magazine, 2021), which provided a good basis to start from. However, some modifications were brought in to enable it to suit the JBC C245. For instance, replacing the power supply by a bigger one and adding a Hirose connector.

"Elektor's PCB (Printed Circuit Board) leans more towards hobbyists as it utilizes only THT (Through-Hole Technology) components. For this project, the PCB was designed with SMT (Surface-Mount Technology) in mind to simulate the way the electronic industry designs their PCB.
